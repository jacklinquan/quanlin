# Markdown reference

This website is written in extended Markdown.
This page serves as a reference on how to write documentation in Markdown.
The usage listed here is what I think practical rather than exhaustive.
In case there is any desired feature unavailable in Markdown,
try using HTML in Markdown files.

---

## Basic syntax

Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in John Gruber’s
original design document.

---

### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a `> ` in front of a paragraph.
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `> ` on the blank lines
between the paragraphs.
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `> > ` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
Blockquotes can contain some other Markdown formatted elements.

!!! example

    *Blockquotes example*:

    ``` markdown
    > The **first** paragraph in the *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    > And some ***extra text*** in the first paragraph.
    >
    > The **second** paragraph in the *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    >
    > ---
    >
    > > A **nested** *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    > > 1. First list item.
    > > 2. Second list item.
    > > 3. Third list item.
    ```

    *Result*:

    > The **first** paragraph in the *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    > And some ***extra text*** in the first paragraph.
    >
    > The **second** paragraph in the *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    >
    > ---
    >
    > > A **nested** *[blockquote](#blockquotes)*.
    > >
    > > 1. First list item.
    > > 2. Second list item.
    > > 3. Third list item.

Blockquotes can also be used as simple admonitions by adding `>` and a space in front of
each paragraph, and adding a suitable admonition type.

!!! example

    *Blockquote admonition example*:

    ``` markdown
    > **Note**: This is a simple single-line note.

    ---

    >    :pencil:**Note**
    >
    >    This is a simple multi-line note. It is generated by highlighting the whole note
        section, adding `tab` and adding `>` in front of each paragraph.
    >
    >    This way is compatible with most of the Markdown applications.
    ```

    *Result*:

    > **Note**: This is a simple single-line note.

    ---

    >    :pencil:**Note**
    >
    >    This is a simple multi-line note. It is generated by highlighting the whole note
        section, adding `tab` and adding `>` in front of each paragraph.
    >
    >    This way is compatible with most of the Markdown applications.

---

### Code blocks

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks `` ` ``.
If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks,
you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks ``` `` ```.
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block
by at least four spaces or one tab.
To create code blocks without indenting lines, use fenced code blocks.
Fenced code block syntax is extended with a lot of extensions.
Fenced code blocks are also used for [diagrams](#diagrams). 

!!! example

    *Inline code example*:

    ``` markdown
    Some inline general code: `text`<br>
    Some inline python code: `#!python from math import pi`
    ```

    *Result*:

    Some inline general code: `text`<br>
    Some inline python code: `#!python from math import pi` 

    ---

    *Code block example*:

    ```` markdown
    ``` python linenums="1" hl_lines="2-3 5"
    def bubble_sort(items):
        for i in range(len(items)):
            for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
                if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                    items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
    ```
    ````

    *Result*:

    ``` python linenums="1" hl_lines="2-3 5"
    def bubble_sort(items):
        for i in range(len(items)):
            for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
                if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                    items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
    ```

When the code is too long, the height can be limited.

!!! example

    *Code block with limited height example*:

    ```` {.markdown .md-max-height}
    ``` {.python .md-max-height hl_lines="2 3-4"}
    --8<-- "scripts/macros_script.py"
    ```
    ````

    *Result*:

    ``` {.python .md-max-height hl_lines="2 3-4"}
    --8<-- "scripts/macros_script.py"
    ```        

---

### Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic or both.

!!! example

    *Emphasis example*:

    ``` markdown
    *Italic text*<br>
    **Bold text**<br>
    ***Both italic and bold text***
    ```

    *Result*:

    *Italic text*<br>
    **Bold text**<br>
    ***Both italic and bold text***

---

### Escaping characters

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text
in a Markdown document,
add a backslash `\` in front of the character.

Characters can be escaped are: `\`, `` ` ``, `*`, `_`, `{}`, `[]`, `<>`, `()`, `#`,
`+`, `-`, `.`, `!`, `|`

!!! note

    To escaping `` ` `` in code, please refer to [code blocks](#code-blocks).<br>
    To escaping `|` in table, please refer to [data tables](#data-tables).

!!! example

    *Escaping characters example*:

    ``` markdown
    \# It is a hash sign instead of heading marker.<br>
    \* It is a asterisk sign instead of list item marker.
    ```

    *Result*:

    \# It is a hash sign instead of heading marker.<br>
    \* It is a asterisk sign instead of list item marker.

---

### Headings

To create a heading, add hash signs `#` and a space in front of a word or phrase.
The number of hash signs you use should correspond to the heading level.
Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of `==` characters for
heading level 1 or `--` characters for heading level 2.

!!! example

    *Headings example*:

    ``` markdown
    # Heading level 1
    
    Another Heading level 1
    =======================

    ## Heading level 2
    
    Another Heading level 2
    -----------------------

    ### Heading level 3

    #### Heading level 4

    ##### Heading level 5

    ###### Heading level 6
    ```

    *Result*:

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h1>Another heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h2>Another heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading level 6</h6>

---

### Horizontal rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more dashes `---` on a line by themselves.

!!! example

    *Horizontal rule example*:

    ``` markdown
    ---
    ```

    *Result*:

    ---

!!! note

    Three or more asterisks `***` or underscores `___` can also be used
    for horizontal rules. 

---

### Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark `!`, followed by alt text in brackets `[]`,
and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses `()`.
You can optionally add a title after the URL in the parentheses.
If relative path is used, the path is relative to the Markdown file directory.
You can also use the reference-style link for the path or URL to the image asset.
With extensions, image alignment, width and lazy-loading can be implemented as well.

!!! example

    *Image example*:

    ``` {.markdown .md-max-height}
    ![Favicon](assets/images/favicon_LQ_48x48.png "Favicon")

    ![Alternative text][dummy_img]{: align=right width=300 loading=lazy }

      [dummy_img]:
        https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–
        "Dummy image"

    This paragraph will be displayed around it.
    ```

    *Result*:

    ![Favicon](assets/images/favicon_LQ_48x48.png "Favicon")

    ![Alternative text][dummy_img]{: align=right width=300 loading=lazy }

      [dummy_img]:
        https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–
        "Dummy image"

    This paragraph will be displayed around it.

---

### Line breaks

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
A more reliable way is to add an HTML line break `<br>` at the end of the line.

!!! example

    *Line break example*:

    ``` markdown
    The first line of the first paragraph.  
    The second line of the first paragraph.<br>
    And the third line of the first paragraph.

    The second paragraph.
    ```

    *Result*:

    The first line of the first paragraph.  
    The second line of the first paragraph.<br>
    And the third line of the first paragraph.

    The second paragraph.

---

### Links

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets `<>`.

!!! example

    *URL and email example*:

    ``` markdown
    <https://www.google.com>

    <example@email.com>
    ```

    *Result*:

    <https://www.google.com>

    <example@email.com>

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets `[]`,
and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses `()`.
You can optionally add a title for a link.
This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.
To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

!!! example

    *Links example*:

    ``` markdown
    [Internal link to "Links" heading](#links "Title for the link")

    [Internal link to another page](index.md#introduction "Home")

    [Google website](https://www.google.com "Google")
    ```

    *Result*:

    [Internal link to "Links" heading](#links "Title for the link")
            
    [Internal link to another page](index.md#introduction "Home")

    [Google website](https://www.google.com "Google")

#### Reference-style links

Reference-style links are a special kind of link.
They make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown.
Reference-style links are constructed in two parts:
the part you keep inline with your text and
the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.

The first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets.
The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked.
The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link
you are storing elsewhere in your document.

The second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes:

1. The label, in brackets `[]`, followed immediately by a colon `:`
    and at least one space.
2. The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets `<>`.
3. The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes `""`,
    single quotes `''`, or parentheses`()`.

!!! example

    *Reference-style links example*:

    ``` markdown
    [Internal link to "Links" heading][links_heading_link]

      [links_heading_link]: #links "Title for the link"

    [Internal link to another page][another_page_link]

      [another_page_link]: index.md#introduction 'Home'

    [Google website][google_link]

      [google_link]: <https://www.google.com> (Google)
    ```

    *Result*:

    [Internal link to "Links" heading][links_heading_link]

      [links_heading_link]: #links "Title for the link"

    [Internal link to another page][another_page_link]

      [another_page_link]: index.md#introduction 'Home'

    [Google website][google_link]

      [google_link]: <https://www.google.com> (Google)

### Lists

You can organise items into ordered and unordered lists.
With extensions, definition lists and task lists are available as well.

#### Unordered lists

An unordered list can be written by prefixing a line with a `-`, `*` or `+` list marker,
all of which can be used interchangeably.
Furthermore, all flavors of lists can be nested inside each other.

!!! example

    *Unordered lists example*:

    ``` markdown
    - List item
    - Another list item
        - Nested list item
        - Another nested list item
    - The last list item
    ```

    *Result*:

    - List item
    - Another list item
        - Nested list item
        - Another nested list item
    - The last list item

#### Ordered Lists

An ordered list must start with a number immediately followed by a dot.
The numbers do not need to be consecutive and can be all set to `1.`,
as they will be re-numbered when rendered.

!!! example

    *Ordered lists example*:

    ``` markdown
    1. List item
    1. Another list item
        1. Nested list item
        1. Another nested list item
    1. The last list item
    ```

    *Result*:

    1. List item
    1. Another list item
        1. Nested list item
        1. Another nested list item
    1. The last list item

#### Definition lists

Definition lists are an ideal for describing arbitrary key-value pairs,
e.g. the parameters of functions or modules.

!!! example

    *Definition lists example*:

    ``` markdown
    Apple
    :   A kind of fruit.

        It is tasty.

    `Python`
    :   A programming language.
        It is very useful.
    ```

    *Result*:

    Apple
    :   A kind of fruit.

        It is tasty.

    `Python`
    :   A programming language.
        It is very useful.

#### Task lists

Unordered list items can be prefixed with `[ ]` to render an unchecked
or `[x]` to render a checked checkbox.

!!! example

    *Task lists example*:

    ``` markdown
    - [x] List item
    - [ ] Another list item
        - [ ] Nested list item
        - [x] Another nested list item
    - [x] The last list item
    ```

    *Result*:

    - [x] List item
    - [ ] Another list item
        - [ ] Nested list item
        - [x] Another nested list item
    - [x] The last list item

---

### Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

!!! example

    *Paragraphs example*:

    ``` markdown
    Paragraph 1.

    Paragraph 2.
    ```

    *Result*:

    Paragraph 1.

    Paragraph 2.

---

## Extended syntax

Not all Markdown applications support extended syntax elements.
They are enabled by using Markdown extensions.

---

### Abbreviations

Technical documentation often incurs the usage of a lot of acronyms,
which may need additional explanation, especially for new user of your project.
Abbreviations can be defined with a special syntax similar to URLs and footnotes
at any point in the Markdown document.

!!! example

    *Abbreviations example*:

    ``` markdown
    What is HTML? And how about URL?

    *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
    *[URL]: Uniform Resource Locator
    ```

    *Result*:

    What is HTML? And how about URL?

With [Snippets](#snippets), content from other files can be embedded,
which is especially useful to include abbreviations from a central file
(a glossary) and embed them into any other file.

!!! example

    *Abbreviations glossary example*:

    ``` markdown
    What is HTML? And how about URL?

    --8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md" 
    ```

    *Contents of* `includes/abbreviations.md`:

    ``` {.markdown .md-max-height}
    --8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"
    ```

    *Result*:

    What is HTML? And how about URL?

---

### Admonitions

Admonitions, also known as *call-outs*, are an excellent choice
for including side content without significantly interrupting the document flow.
Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists,
paragraphs and other blocks.

Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block must start with `!!!`,
followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block.
The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces.

??? example "Valid type qualifiers"

    The default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is `note`.
    
    `note`, `seealso`
    :   !!! note
            Content.

    `abstract`, `summary`, `tldr`
    :   !!! abstract
            Content.

    `info`, `todo`
    :   !!! info
            Content.

    `tip`, `hint`, `important`
    :   !!! tip
            Content.

    `success`, `check`, `done`
    :   !!! success
            Content.

    `question`, `help`, `faq`
    :   !!! question
            Content.

    `warning`, `caution`, `attention`
    :   !!! warning
            Content.

    `failure`, `fail`, `missing`
    :   !!! failure
            Content.

    `danger`, `error`
    :   !!! danger
            Content.

    `bug`
    :   !!! bug
            Content.

    `example`
    :   !!! example
            Content.

    `quote`, `cite`
    :   !!! quote
            Content.

!!! example

    *Simple example*:

    ``` markdown
    !!! note
        Content.
    ```

    *Result*:

    !!! note
        Content.
    
By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase.
However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown
(including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier.

!!! example

    *Customised title example*:

    ``` markdown
    !!! note "Customised *title* with a [link](#admonitions)"
        Content.
    ```

    *Result*:

    !!! note "Customised *title* with a [link](#admonitions)"
        Content.

Similar to customised title, the icon and title can be omitted entirely
by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier.

!!! note

    This will not work for [Details](#details).

!!! example

    *Omitted title example*:

    ``` markdown
    !!! note ""
        Content.
    ```

    *Result*:

    !!! note ""
        Content.

#### Details

Details is collapsible admonition blocks that is able to hide their content.
It uses the HTML5 `<details><summary>` tags to accomplish this.
It supports nesting and you can also force the default state to be open.
Details is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature.
A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks,
but must start with `???`.

!!! note

    Due to how new `<details><summary>` tags are, not all browsers support them yet.

!!! example

    *Details example*:

    ``` markdown hl_lines="1"
    ??? note
        Content.
    ```

    *Result*:

    ??? note
        Content.

Adding a `+` after `???` will render the block as open on page load:

!!! example

    *Open styled details example*:

    ``` markdown hl_lines="1"
    ???+ note
        Content.
    ```

    *Result*:

    ???+ note
        Content.

Admonitions and Details can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e.
sidebars), moving them to the right using the `inline` + `end` modifiers, or
to the left using only the `inline` modifier.

=== "inline end"

    *Example* / *Result*:

    !!! info inline end
        Content.

    ``` markdown
    !!! info inline end
        Content.
    ```

    Use `inline end` to align to the right.

=== "inline"

    *Example* / *Result*:

    !!! info inline
        Content.

    ``` markdown
    !!! info inline
        Content.
    ```

    Use `inline` to align to the left.

*If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block,
the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport,
e.g. on mobile viewports.*

---

### Buttons

Any clickable element can be converted into a button by adding
the `.md-button` CSS class, which will receive the selected primary color.

!!! example

    *Buttons example*:

    ``` markdown
    [Button:material-gesture-tap-button:][dummy_js]{: .md-button }
    [Button:material-gesture-tap-button:][dummy_js]{: .md-button .md-button--primary }

      [dummy_js]: javascript:alert$.next("Done!")
    ```

    *Result*:

    [Button:material-gesture-tap-button:][dummy_js]{: .md-button }
    [Button:material-gesture-tap-button:][dummy_js]{: .md-button .md-button--primary }

      [dummy_js]: javascript:alert$.next("Done!")

---

### Content tabs

Sometimes, it's desirable to group alternative content under different tabs,
e.g. when describing how to access an API from different languages or environments.
Tabs start with `===` to signify a tab followed by a quoted title.
Consecutive tabs are grouped into a tab set.

!!! example

    *Tabs example*:

    ``` markdown
    === "Tab 1"
        Markdown **content**.

    === "Tab 2"
        More Markdown **content**.
    ```

    *Result*:

    === "Tab 1"
        Markdown **content**.

    === "Tab 2"
        More Markdown **content**.

In the rare case that you want to follow two separate tab sets right after each other,
you can explicitly mark the start of a new tab set with `!`.

!!! example

    *Tab breaks example*:
    
    ```` markdown
    === "Tab 1"
        Markdown **content**.

        Multiple paragraphs.

    === "Tab 2"
        More Markdown **content**.

        - List item a
        - List item b

    ===! "Tab A"
        Different tab set.

    === "Tab B"
        ```
        More content.
        ```
    ````
    
    *Result*:
    
    === "Tab 1"
    
        Markdown **content**.

        Multiple paragraphs.

    === "Tab 2"
    
        More Markdown **content**.

        - List item a
        - List item b

    ===! "Tab A"
    
        Different tab set.

    === "Tab B"
    
        ```
        More content.
        ```

---

### Data tables

Data tables can be used at any position in your project documentation and can contain
arbitrary Markdown, including inline code blocks, as well as icons and emojis.
You can display a pipe `|` character in a table by using its HTML character code
`&#124;`. If you want to align a specific column to the `left`, `center` or `right`,
you can use the regular Markdown syntax placing `:` characters at the beginning
and/or end of the divider.

=== "Left"

    *Example*:

    ``` markdown hl_lines="2"
    | Method      | Description                          |
    | :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |
    ```

    *Result*:

    | Method      | Description                          |
    | :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |

=== "Center"

    *Example*:

    ``` markdown hl_lines="2"
    | Method      | Description                          |
    | :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |
    ```

    *Result*:

    | Method      | Description                          |
    | :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |

=== "Right"

    *Example*:

    ``` markdown hl_lines="2"
    | Method      | Description                          |
    | ----------: | -----------------------------------: |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |
    ```

    *Result*:

    | Method      | Description                          |
    | ----------: | -----------------------------------: |
    | `GET`       | :material-check:     Fetch resource  |
    | `PUT`       | :material-check-all: Update resource |
    | `DELETE`    | :material-close:     Delete resource |

### Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams are written as code blocks.
They must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks.

!!! example

    *Diagrams example*:

    ```` markdown
    ``` mermaid
    graph LR
      A[Start] --> B{Error?}
      B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]
      C --> D[Debug]
      D --> B
      B -->|No| E[Yay!]
    ```
    ````

    *Result*:

    ``` mermaid
    graph LR
      A[Start] --> B{Error?}
      B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]
      C --> D[Debug]
      D --> B
      B -->|No| E[Yay!]
    ```

*See the [official documentation][mermaid_link] to learn about all diagram types.*

### Emojis + Icons + Keys

Emojis can be integrated in Markdown by putting the shortcode of the emoji between
two colons.

!!! example

    *Emojis example*:

    ```
    - :smile:
    - :label: : `tag1` `tag2` `tag3`
    ```

    *Result*:

    - :smile:
    - :label: : `tag1` `tag2` `tag3`

Icons can be used similar to emojis, by referencing a valid path to any icon bundled
with the theme, which are located in the `.icons` directory, and replacing `/` with `-`.

!!! example

    *Icons example*:

    ```
    - :material-tag-multiple: : `tag1` `tag2` `tag3`
    - :material-account-circle: – `.icons/material/account-circle.svg`
    - :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: – `.icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg`
    - :octicons-octoface-24: – `.icons/octicons/octoface-24.svg`
    ```

    *Result*:

    - :material-tag-multiple: : `tag1` `tag2` `tag3`
    - :material-account-circle: – `.icons/material/account-circle.svg`
    - :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: – `.icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg`
    - :octicons-octoface-24: – `.icons/octicons/octoface-24.svg`

Consult the [Icons + Emojis][icon_emoji_link] documentation to search available
icons and emojis.

  [icon_emoji_link]: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/

Keyboard keys can be rendered with a simple syntax. If you need a way to quickly
enter a one time, arbitrary key, you can just insert it directly, instead of
specifying the key's name, by quoting the content displayed instead of a key name.
You can also enter HTML entities if desired.

!!! example

    *Keys example*:
    
    ``` markdown
    ++ctrl+alt+del++
    
    ++ctrl+alt+"My Special Key"++

    ++cmd+alt+"&Uuml;"++
    ```

    *Result*:
    
    ++ctrl+alt+del++
    
    ++ctrl+alt+"My Special Key"++

    ++cmd+alt+"&Uuml;"++

Consult the [Keys][keys_link] documentation to learn about all
available key codes.

### Footnotes

Footnotes are a great way to add references to supplemental or additional information
for a specific section of a document without interrupting the document flow.
A footnote reference must be enclosed in square brackets and must start with
a caret `^`, directly followed by an arbitrary identifier, which is similar to
the standard Markdown link syntax. The footnote content must be declared with
the same identifier as the reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position
in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page.
Furthermore, a backlink to the footnote reference is automatically added.

!!! example

    *Footnotes example*:

    ``` markdown
    Something needs supplemental information[^1] and additional information[^2].
    
    [^1]: Footnote on a single line. Short statements can be written on the same line.
    
    [^2]:
        Footnote on multiple lines.
        Paragraphs can be written on the next line and must be indented by four spaces.
    ```

    *Result*:

    Something needs supplemental information[^1] and additional information[^2].

    [^1]: Footnote on a single line. Short statements can be written on the same line.

    [^2]:
        Footnote on multiple lines.
        Paragraphs can be written on the next line and must be indented by four spaces.
        Footnotes are a great way to add references to supplemental or additional
        information for a specific section of a document without interrupting the
        document flow.

### Formatting

Critic Markup can be used to highlight suggested changes, as well as add inline
comments to a document.

!!! example

    *Critic example*:

    ``` markdown
    Text can be {​--deleted--} and replacement text {​++added++}. This can also be
    combined into {​~~one~>a single~~} operation. {​==Highlighting==} is also
    possible {​>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

    {​==

    Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing
    tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.

    ==}
    ```

    *Result*:

    Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
    combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
    possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

    {==

    Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing
    tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.

    ==}

Caret, Mark and Tilde can highlight text with a nice syntax.

!!! example

    *Highlighting example*:

    ``` markdown 
    - ==This was marked==
    - ^^This was inserted^^
    - ~~This was deleted~~
    ```

    *Result*:

    - ==This was marked==
    - ^^This was inserted^^
    - ~~This was deleted~~

Caret and Tilde can also be used to sub- and superscript text.

!!! example

    *Sub- and superscripts example*:

    ``` markdown 
    - H~2~O
    - A^T^A
    ```

    *Result*:

    - H~2~O
    - A^T^A

### Macros

Macros and variables are powerful tools to parametrize Markdown files, as they allow to
perform Jinja templating directly from Markdown. This is especially useful to include
technical data from other files and add central variables via `mkdocs.yml`.
Consult [macros][macros_link] plugin documentation for detailed usage.

  [macros_link]: https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin

#### Predefined variables

A set of predefined variables is enabled by default and can be used from Markdown,
including data from `mkdocs.yml`. More specifically, predefined variables fall into
the following categories:

- `config.*`: configuration parameters from `mkdocs.yml`
- `page.*`: metadata and content of current page
- `navigation.*`: list of all pages and sections
- `environment.*`: underlying operating system
- `git.*`: git-related information, if available

!!! example

    *Predefined variables example*:

    ``` markdown
    The site name is {{ '{{ config.site_name }}' }}.
    ```

    _Result_:

    The site name is {{ config.site_name }}.

A list of all predefined variables can be printed with:

``` markdown
{{ '{{ macros_info() }}' }}
```

#### Custom variables

All data defined under `extra` in `mkdocs.yml` is automatically exposed as a variable
and can be used from the template. This enables centralized parameter storage and
management.

!!! example

    *Custom variables example*:

    ``` markdown
    The unit price is {{ '{{ unit.price }}' }}.
    ```

    *In "mkdocs.yml"*:

    ``` yaml
    extra:
      unit:
        price: 12.50
    ```

    *Result*:

    The unit price is 12.50.

#### CSV tables

The macros plugin allows to define custom macros, which can then be used from Markdown
files. There is a custom macro `csv_table` that can be used to load csv tables easily.

*Macro `csv_table` example*:

``` markdown
{{ "{{ csv_table('assets/csvtables/example.csv', colalign=('left',)*3) }}" }}
```

*Generated table*:

``` markdown
{{ csv_table('assets/csvtables/example.csv', colalign=('left',)*3) }}
```

*Result*:

{{ csv_table('assets/csvtables/example.csv', colalign=('left',)*3) }}

#### YouTube

There is also a custom macro `youtube` that can be used to play YouTube videos.

!!! example

    *Macro `youtube` simple example*:

    ``` markdown
    {{ "{{ youtube('5W3WvXAmDJc') }}" }}
    ```

    *Result*:

    {{ youtube('5W3WvXAmDJc') }}

If you want more control over the video, you can also specify the parameters for
`width`, `height`, `frameborder`, `playlist`, `autoplay`, `mute`, `loop` and `controls`. 

!!! example

    *Macro `youtube` comprehensive example*:

    ``` markdown
    {{
    "
    {{
    youtube(
        'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5W3WvXAmDJc?playlist=5W3WvXAmDJc,DFp_T-H3eRc&autoplay=0&mute=0&loop=0&controls=1',
        640,
        360,
        0
    )
    }}
    "
    }}
    ```

    *Result*:

    {{
    youtube(
        'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5W3WvXAmDJc?playlist=5W3WvXAmDJc,DFp_T-H3eRc&autoplay=0&mute=0&loop=0&controls=1',
        640,
        360,
        0
    )
    }}

### MathJax

MathJax is a beautiful and accessible way to display mathematical content in the
browser, allows for writing formulas in different notations, including LaTeX,
MathML and AsciiMath.

Inline blocks must be enclosed in `#!latex $...$` or `#!latex \(...\)`:

!!! example

    *Inline Example*:
    
    ``` latex
    The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
    singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
    that $f(a)=f(b)$.
    
    $p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, \(p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\).
    ```
    
    *Result*:
    
    The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
    singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
    that $f(a)=f(b)$.
    
    $p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, \(p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\).

Blocks must be enclosed in `#!latex $$...$$` or `#!latex \[...\]`on separate lines:

!!! example

    *Block Example*:
    
    ``` latex
    $$
    \operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
    $$
    
    $$
    E(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{h}) = -\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \sum_i b_i v_i - \sum_j c_j h_j
    $$

    \[3 < 4\]

    \begin{align}
        p(v_i=1|\mathbf{h}) & = \sigma\left(\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\right) \\
        p(h_j=1|\mathbf{v}) & = \sigma\left(\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\right)
    \end{align}
    ```
    
    *Result*:
    
    $$
    \operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
    $$
    
    $$
    E(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{h}) = -\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \sum_i b_i v_i - \sum_j c_j h_j
    $$

    \[3 < 4\]

    \begin{align}
        p(v_i=1|\mathbf{h}) & = \sigma\left(\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\right) \\
        p(h_j=1|\mathbf{v}) & = \sigma\left(\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\right)
    \end{align}

### Meta tags

In HTML, `meta` tags allow to provide additional metadata for a document, e.g. page
titles and descriptions, additional assets to be loaded, and [Open Graph][ogp_link]
data. While metadata can always be added via customization, some tags can be configured.

  [ogp_link]: https://ogp.me/

The page title can be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter.
This will set the `title` tag inside the document `head` for the current page to
the provided value. Note that the site title is appended using a dash as a separator,
which is the default behavior.

!!! example

    ``` markdown
    ---
    title: The title of the page.
    ---
    ```

The page description can also be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front
matter. This will set the `meta` tag containing the site description inside the
document `head` for the current page to the provided value.

!!! example

    ``` markdown
    ---
    description: The description of the page.
    ---
    ```

A "web app manifest" is a simple JSON file that specifies how your web application
should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop, which can be set
via `mkdocs.yml`:

!!! example

    ``` yaml
    extra:
      manifest: manifest.webmanifest
    ```

### Snippets

Snippets is an extension to insert markdown or HTML snippets into another markdown file.
Snippets is great for situations where you have content you need to insert into
multiple documents. For instance, this document keeps all its hyperlinks in a separate
file. Then includes those hyperlinks at the bottom of a document via snippets.
If a link needs to be updated, it can be updated in one location instead of updating
them in multiple files.

Snippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc.,
it will still get processed. This is great for including the current version of program
code. If the specified file cannot be found, then the markup will be removed.
If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, you can escape it by adding a
space after the snippets notation.

Snippets can handle recursive file inclusion. And if Snippets encounters the same file
in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite
loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth). Though it should be said, you should
extreme recursion depth as you will hit Python's recursion limit.

Snippets does not care what the extension or the content of the ASCII file is.
There are two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block.

Single line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation:

``` markdown
--8<-- "filename.ext" 
```

Or you can insert multiple files with block notation:

``` markdown
--8<-- 
filename.md
filename.log
--8<-- 
```

The notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name. In the case
of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and
is quoted. In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines
and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block.

The dashes can be as few as 2 (`--8<--`) or longer if desired (`---8<---------`);
whatever your preference is. The important thing is that the notation must reside on
a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line
notation. If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level
as well. To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block
is indented to the same level. If you need to escape the syntax, just make sure
a minimum of a space is after the quoted file name for single line format, or a space
after the start or end block markers in block format.

``` markdown
--8<-- "escaped notation"<space> 

--8<--<space> 
escaped notation
--8<--<space> 
```

If you have a file you want to temporarily ignore, you can comment it out by
prepending the path with `; `(notice the semicolon is followed by a space).
This works for both single line and block format:

``` markdown
--8<-- "; skip.md" 

--8<-- 
include.md
; skip.md
--8<-- 
```

When inserting your snippet, it is important to remember that some snippets may need
whitespace around them:

``` markdown
This is the file that is including the snippet.
We want blank lines before and after the insertion:

--8<-- "insert.md" 

So we put blank lines around the insertion.
```

In block format, it is important to note that empty lines are preserved for formatting:

``` markdown
--8<-- 
file1.md

file2.md
--8<-- 
```

!!! example

    *Snippets example*:
    
    ```` {.markdown .md-max-height}
    ``` {.md-max-height}
    --8<-- "requirements.txt" 
    ```
    
    ``` {.yaml .md-max-height}
    --8<-- 
    ../mkdocs.yml
    --8<-- 
    ```
    ````
    
    *Result*:
    
    ``` {.md-max-height}
    --8<-- "requirements.txt"
    ```
    
    ``` {.yaml .md-max-height}
    --8<--
    ../mkdocs.yml
    --8<--
    ```

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"
