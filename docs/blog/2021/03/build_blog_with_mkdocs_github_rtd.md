# Build a blog on "Read the Docs"

:material-tag-multiple: :
`blog` `mkdocs` `github` `read the docs`


## Introduction

This blog summarises how to build a blog on RTD with MkDocs and GitHub.
This combination might not suit everyone but meets most of my needs. 
I want to write my blogs in a quick manner but still in a nice-look format.
I want to publish my blogs easily and spend less time on publishing process.
I want the modifications to be easily traceable.
I want the whole blog site to be moveable and easy to migrate to another site.
I've been using RTD, MkDocs and GitHub for project documentation.
And I found them good for building a blog website too.

## Pros and cons

*Pros*:

- Blogs are written in Markdown.
  MkDocs got heaps of useful plugins and Markdown extensions that makes writing
  documentation a piece of cake.
- The way to publish on GitHub and render on RTD is easy and mature.
- GitHub as a version control tool natually traces the modifications.
- MkDocs generates a static HTML website from the Markdown files.
  It is highly moveable because there is no database associated with it.

*Cons*:

- Each file size is limited to 100MB and the total repository size is limited to 10GB
  by GitHub. A rough calculation suggests I won't hit these limits for decades.
